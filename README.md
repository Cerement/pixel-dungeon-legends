"Roguelike is a sub-genre of role-playing video games, characterized by random level generation, tile-based graphics and permanent death." - Wikipedia

Players who play games of this genre for the first time may die often and feel frustrating. However, even it feels like everything is based on luck, there are some tricks to help you beat the game, once you play more and get used to it. If you get stuck on something, you can check the wiki of the original Pixel Dungeon.
